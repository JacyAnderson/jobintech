### Job Search Tips (Straight Forward, and Not-So-Much)
* For any site that allows you to set alerts (Glassdoor), set for multiple job titles (i.e. jr web developer, web developer, frontend developer, backend developer, Angular dev, React dev, etc) so you get the most up-to-date job postings when they're posted. 

* Not all companies post jobs on the main job hosting sites, so sometimes you have to get creative.
    - Walk around Industry/WeWork, etc and write down the names of any companies you find. Take your list home and look each company up, checking for job postings on their sites. 
    - Think of what field (other than tech) you want to work in, type it in Google, and follow it up with 'tech companies based in Denver' (i.e. 'Education tech companies based in Denver'). Similarly, type in the type of place you want to work (web agency, Denver based startup, etc) and check out their Career pages. 

* A solid amount of jobs come from networking (loaded term, just go drink and make friends), and a great way to find events is through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/cities/us/co/denver/) or on [Built in Colorado](https://www.builtincolorado.com/). 

* Sometimes we don't have to look farther than General Assembly for amazing opportunities. Check out their [Classes & Workshops](https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshops) where people come from all sorts of backgrounds and other tech companies looking to expand their skills. Expand upon your hirability and maybe meet the person who will hire you along the way. UXDI showcase coming up? Go meet a friend - I've gotten gigs from past students & new friends.
